![Compound](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielneal/compound/master/compound3.png)

Compound is a micro structure for data used in reagent (and re-frame etc) applications.

It is nowhere close to as expressive or powerful as datascript, but it provides a little extra functionality over storing data in a map indexed by one thing. It is useful if you have relational data that has more than one access pattern, and want to avoid repeated linear scans, but for some reason datascript is not an ideal fit (e.g. with reframe, to avoid recomputing every query whenever the database changes)

```

## Usage

Say I have a bunch of data about dressmaking patterns.

```
(def pattern-data
  #{{:id 1
     :source :instituto-di-moda
     :difficulty :medium
     :pattern :bodice-basic}

    {:id 2
     :source :instituto-di-moda
     :difficulty :easy
     :pattern :shirt-basic}

    {:id 3
     :source :instituto-di-moda
     :difficulty :easy
     :pattern :bodice-dartless}

    {:id 4
     :source :winifred-aldrich
     :difficulty :medium
     :pattern :dress-princess-seam}

    {:id 5
     :source :winifred-aldrich
     :pattern :winter-coat
     :difficulty :hard}})

```
And I want to access them (in various bits of the ui), by source, by difficulty, by pattern.

I can set up a compound, using `(empty-compound <index-defs>)`

```
(require [compound.core :as c])
(require [compound.indexes.one-to-many])

(def patterns
  (c/empty-compound #{#:compound.index{:type :compound.index.types/primary
                                       :conflict-behaviour :compound.conflict-behaviours/upsert
                                       :key-fn :id
                                       :id :id}

                      #:compound.index{:type :compound.index.types/one-to-many
                                       :key-fn :source
                                       :id :source}

                      #:compound.index{:type :compound.index.types/one-to-many
                                       :key-fn :difficulty
                                       :id :difficulty}}))

```

Add and remove items as follows.

```
(-> (c/add p pattern-data) ;; add the items
    (c/remove [1 2])) ;; remove using the primary key

#:compound{:index-defs
           {:id
            #:compound.index{:type :compound.index.types/primary,
                             :conflict-behaviour
                             :compound.conflict-behaviours/upsert,
                             :key-fn :id,
                             :id :id},
            :difficulty
            #:compound.index{:type :compound.index.types/one-to-many,
